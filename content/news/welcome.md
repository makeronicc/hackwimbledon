Welcome to HackWimbledon. Pardon our dust... we're having a rebuild. Pop over to [Makeroni](https://makeroni.cc/) for the original site. Quick explainer... HackWimbledon was the original event, ten years ago, as a physical meetup. 

When Covid landed, we morphed into Makeroni, an online thing. And since then we've been bringing back HackWimbledon. Hop over to [Meetings](/meetings) to find out how to come along through the our Luma calendar where you can get up to date.

Anyway, we're a small popup Hackspace full of friendly makers who chat on Discord (get an invite to [Makeroni/HackWimbledon](https://discord.com/invite/HYYXHSu). 

And we meetup around twice a month in Wimbledon at Wimbletech within the Library complex. We chat about making, projects, help each other out, give each other ideas, figure out solutions and teach folks how to do it themselves. When we say make we mean everything from electronics, to assembling computers, to creating robots, to building Home automation, to well whatever we make it.

If you want to get in touch by mail, drop a line to us at [makeronicc@gmail.com](mailto:makeronicc@gmail.com).

More to come here soon.... but join in now.
